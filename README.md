# Google API Speech Recognition Test

This is a project that demonstrates in a very simple way the use of the Google API of speech recognition. It can be used as part of a bot project, for example.

The project, on a web server, allows the user to search something on google through the voice. That is, the user speaks what they want to search and the API turns the speech into text to perform the search on Google.

## Requirements

This project requires that you have [Google Speech API].
